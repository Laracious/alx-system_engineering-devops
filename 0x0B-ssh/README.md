## Tasks

### 0. Use a private key
* Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.

### 1. Create an SSH key pair
* Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

### 2. Client configuration file
* Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

### 3. Let me in!
* Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.
