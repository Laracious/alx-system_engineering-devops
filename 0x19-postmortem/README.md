# Postmortem: Service Outage and Performance Degradation
### This document provides a comprehensive overview of the service outage and performance degradation incident that occurred on our mental health platform. It includes details about the duration, impact, timeline, root cause, resolution, as well as corrective and preventative measures taken to address the issue and prevent future occurrences.

## Issue Summary
### Duration: June 1, 2023, 08:00 AM to June 2, 2023, 02:00 AM (WAT)
###Impact: Slow response times and intermittent downtime experienced by users accessing our mental health platform, affecting approximately 30% of the user base.
# Timeline:
###Issue detected: June 1, 2023, 08:30 AM (WAT) through monitoring alerts indicating high latency and increased error rates.

###Actions taken: The investigation began by checking the server logs, database performance, and network connectivity, assuming the issue was related to infrastructure or database load.
###Misleading investigation paths: Initially, the focus was on scaling up the infrastructure and optimizing database queries, but no significant improvement was observed.
###Escalation: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team and senior engineers on June 1, 2023, 10:00 AM (WAT) when the root cause was not immediately apparent.
###Incident resolution: The issue was resolved by June 2, 2023, 02:00 AM (WAT) after identifying and mitigating a software bug in the authentication module.
## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root cause: The root cause was traced to a race condition in the authentication module, which caused intermittent failures in user session handling and impacted overall system performance.
###Resolution: The bug was identified by reviewing the codebase and performing extensive testing. A patch was deployed to address the race condition and ensure consistent session management. Additionally, the database connection pool settings were optimized to handle the load more efficiently.
## Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements:
### Implement thorough unit and integration testing to identify potential race conditions and critical bugs during development.
###Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect anomalies in system performance and latency.
###Introduce automated load testing scenarios to simulate real-world usage patterns and identify performance bottlenecks.

## Tasks:
### Apply the authentication module patch to all production servers and perform comprehensive testing to ensure its effectiveness.
### Conduct a thorough code review of the entire application to identify and address any similar race condition vulnerabilities.
###Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for improved debugging during future incidents.
### Schedule regular load testing to proactively identify performance issues and optimize system capacity accordingly.

## Conclusion
### The service outage and performance degradation experienced on our mental health platform were attributed to a race condition in the authentication module. Through thorough investigation and collaboration among teams, we successfully resolved the issue and implemented measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. By continuously improving our testing, monitoring, and development practices, we aim to provide a reliable and seamless experience for our users while ensuring the stability and performance of our platform.
